If you are reading this and you are not me, the author, then I will give you an overview of this project.  
This is a paypal ready site to sell stuff online.  The setup is to allow multiple sellers to upload a photo 
of a product, enter a description and submit it for review to be sold on the website.  The content is dyanamically
generated so that an approved item is instantly added to the site for sale.  A processed sale removes the item from 
the website which alleviates the stress of managing all these items.  Also, I've set up Active Mailer to notify the 
administrator as well as relevant sellers among key points in the customer experience. 

It's not all that complete.  But I put it up on Github so that a potential employer can view the controllers and 
whatnot.  If you are looking to short cut your way into building an e-commerce solution site, I would make sure
you already are familiar with rails before attempting to adopt this. 

Some of the features I'd like to highlight: 
* Robust ActiveMailer design to assist the sale of a dissiminated inventory
* Zoomcloud jQuerry plugin.  The same one featured on Bannana Republic webpage.  
* User interface designed for artists, not techies.
* Administration dashboard that highlights incomplete orders and income earned.
* Built to support a business model that pays web developer a percentage of sales
* Instant Payment Notification with paypal.  Funds are approved then item is removed from marketplace.
* Artist highlight: dynamically generated and SEO friendly URL that accesses artist bio.
* Authorization system: nobody can mess with each other's stuff
* smart use of partials: seller and admin sections don't have the sidebars or shopping cart.
* WYSIWYG editing for administrator.
* validations for adding new items
* approval process for complete administration controll.

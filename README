If you are reading this and you are not me, the author, then I will give you an overview of this project.  
This is a paypal ready site to sell stuff online.  The setup is to allow multiple sellers to upload a photo 
of a product, enter a description and submit it for review to be sold on the website.  The content is dyanamically
generated so that an approved item is instantly added to the site for sale.  A processed sale removes the item from 
the website which alleviates the stress of managing all these items.  Also, I've set up Active Mailer to notify the 
administrator as well as relevant sellers among key points in the customer experience. 

It's not all that complete.  But I put it up on Github so that a potential employer can view the controllers and 
whatnot.  If you are looking to short cut your way into building an e-commerce solution site, I would make sure
you already are familiar with rails before attempting to adopt this.
